summary: System for smaller, more focused backups
description: |
  Cutback is a backup system with the goal of creating smaller, more focused backups by generating
  filtered file lists before archiving and keeping records of easily reaquirable files.
strategy: |
  1. Gather all files within search paths
    * Skip
      * Files matching exclusion patterns
      * Files matching record patterns
    * Save to `ID.manifest`
  2. Gather all files within search paths
    * Only
      * Files matching record patterns
    * Save to `ID.records`
  3. Archive files within the manifest
    * Only
      * Files within the manifest
    * Save to `ID.tar[.COMPRESSION-SUFFIX]`
  4. Create checksum
  5. Gather metadata
    * Backup
      * Date & time (UTC)
      * Search paths
      * Duration
    * Manifest
      * File count
      * Total file size
    * Archive
      * Compression
        * Enabled
        * Tool (gzip, xz, etc.)
        * Flags (passed to the tool)
      * Checksum
        * Tool (sha256sum, sha512sum, etc.)
        * Value
    * Save to `ID.{yaml,json}`
